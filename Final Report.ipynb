    "## Introduction\n",
    "Our global economy drives and depends on functioning companies all around the world, and the characteristics that all organizations have in common are their need and value of their workforce. Employees are one of the most valuable assets and retaining quantity and quality of employees are crucial in running a dependable organization (Negi et. Al, 2013). The failure to do so is called employee attrition, which is a costly challenge faced by many employers around the world. The latter however, is inevitable and managing it is a challenge. Understanding reasons or predictors that could explain employee attrition would provide managers with areas to focus and improve on in the future to improve employee retention (Frye et. Al, 2018). "
